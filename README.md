# css-clock

An responsive analog clock made using mostly HTML elements with CSS and vanilla javascript.

I used javascript to set the time and set the angles for the numbers and tick marks.

Then I used linear gradients to make the majority of each tick mark transparent. I used that same trick on each hand of the clock to make them different sizes.
