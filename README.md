# css-clock

A responsive analog clock made using HTML elements with CSS and vanilla javascript.

I used javascript to create the tick marks and update the clocks time every second.

Then I used linear gradients to make the tick marks and to make the hands of the clock different lengths.

This project came from Wes Bos' Javascript 30 challenge.
